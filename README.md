## Welcome! 
Background:<br><br>
My experience is primarily based in Cpp and digital audio synthesis, although it has expanded to web and native application development. I also have experience with an assortment of network utilities and local server optimization techniques, in addition to jtag IC programming tools and PCB CAD design and implementation.<br>
